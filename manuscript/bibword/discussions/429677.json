If I add some more citations it's only counting up the numbers and doesn't display the number of the bib entry. The hyperlink itself\r\n is ok and word jumps to the correct place in the bibliography.</p>\r\n<p>Hope someone knows a solution to this issue or do i use IEEE wrong?</p>\r\n<p>Greetings</p>\r\n<p>Joe&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
