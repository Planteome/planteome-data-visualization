I would like to insert a line break between each entry in my bibliography to make it easier to read, but cannot figure out what command to insert (see example below). Would you have any ideas on how to do this? Also, is it possible to replace the title &quot;Bibliography&quot; that appears at the top of the bibliography field with another title like &quot;References&quot;?</p>\r\n<p>I would like to change this:</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Birkhoff, G.
