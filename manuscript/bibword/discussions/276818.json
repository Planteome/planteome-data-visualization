Also, the version that I found closest to Newports (Anglia) doesn't have the style for interviews programmed in. I have read a discussion about copying a section from Leeds version, but I would not know where to begin to do this, and the\r\n Leeds version doesn't conform quite anyway.</p>\r\n<p>Is it possible, if I can provide a pdf of the conventions, for you create one of those downloads? I'm sure everyone at Newport Uni would be grateful.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
