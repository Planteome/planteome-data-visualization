For example, the only 'legal' source type is <em>Case</em>. There is no source type for statutes, bills, hearings, laws, ...</li>\r\n    <li>Word generates citations independent of each other. This means that you manually have to indicate if a work has been cited before to ensure the short or ibid forms of the citation are displayed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are ways around those shortcoming, but you have to wonder if the tool is working so much against you, if it is really worth the effort you are going to put into creating a style.</p>\r\n<p>You could use the <a href=\"http://bibword.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=20331\">Chicago footnote style</a> as a starting point as it contains built-in features for short and ibid versions.</p>\r\n",
