I have infact tried to replace the comma within the separator tags with semi-colon - that did not work and then had gone through all the discussions and FAQs, but still I could not get a solution. hen only I tried to replace with &lt;xsl:text&gt;;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;\r<br />\n<br />\nPlease correct me if I am wrong but if you will notice, the output by the default ACM-Citation Sequence does not show the comma between the citations, i.e., it appears as [12] [13] [5] [14] [1] instead of appearing as [12], [13], [5], [14], [1].<br />\n<blockquote>\nIt has also proved to be effective in protein classification [11] and gene expression-based cancer subtype discovery [12] [13] [5] [14] [1].<br />\n</blockquote>\nSame is the case of the output by Nature: appears as 12 13 5 14 1 instead of 12, 13, 5, 14, 1.<br />\n<blockquote>\nIt has also proved to be effective in protein classification 11 and gene expression-based cancer subtype discovery 12 13 5 14 1. <br />\n</blockquote>\nWhere am I going wrong?
