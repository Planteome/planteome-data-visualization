Although it is nowhere officially stated that they should, it seems to be the common case. But as it is nowhere officially stated, the style&nbsp;doesn't do&nbsp;it automatically.</p>",

    "Html": "<p>What do you mean by 2 versions?&nbsp;The only difference I can see is the abbreviation of names between 1 to 3 and 4 to 5.</p>\r\n<p>Like I said in my original reply, the style doesn't abbreviate the names as I have no&nbsp;conclusive information that they should be. The style just takes the different parts of the names as you inputted them and outputs them in the correct order (first middle last). If you input some of them abbreviated and some not, then that is your choice.</p>\r\n<p>If you wanted them all abbreviated, you could change the formatting&nbsp;to always apply abbreviation.
