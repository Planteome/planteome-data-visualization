    "Html": "Hi, I've downloaded the Vancouver style for Windows 8, Microsoft Word 7, but now the in-text citations are all showing up as (1), not in any sequential order. When I insert the bibliography, the references are numbered, and the bibliography itself is a field, but not the in-text citations (they just show up as regular text). \r<br />\n<br />\nAny ideas what I can do? I'm not terribly comfortable with programming terminology, so the simpler the instructions, the better! \r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance!<br />\n",
