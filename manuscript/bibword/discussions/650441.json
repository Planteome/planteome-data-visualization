It is by default sorted by b:First instead of b:Last, so to have it properly displayed, I have to change all &quot;firsts&quot; into &quot;lasts&quot; in all files regarding citations (style, author etc.).\r<br />\nWhere the hack can I find the file that determines the way of sorting under this button?\r<br />\nBest,\r<br />\nStefan<br />\n",
