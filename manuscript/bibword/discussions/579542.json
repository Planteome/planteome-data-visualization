In all styles I have tried so far citations in the main text are <em>at best</em> displayed as &quot;(Author, 2001)&quot;. However, I would like to get it automatically as &quot;Author (2001)&quot;. Is this possible?\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there a style that does this automatically?\r<br />\nCan I program this myself? \r<br />\n<br />\nThanks a lot for your help in advance,\r<br />\nmh<br />\n",

So something like below<br />\n<pre><code>    &lt;citation&gt;\n      &lt;!-- a lot of other code --&gt;\n       &lt;source type=&quot;Book&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;format&gt;{%Author:0%{ (%Year%)}}&lt;/format&gt;\n      &lt;/source&gt;     \n      &lt;!-- a lot of other code --&gt;\n    &lt;/citation&gt;</code></pre>\n\n",

I don't need to use the &quot;suppress title&quot; option, so was hoping to use it for a different purpose, i.e. when unselected the citation appears as &quot;(Author, 2001)&quot;, and when selected it appears as &quot;Author (2001)&quot;.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf this is not possible, is there another option, e.g. using the &quot;\\f&quot; switch mentioned on page 15 of your manual?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nMichael<br />\n",

But without testing I would expect that element to be empty if you didn't provide an actual prefix. You would be better of using one of the suppression flags (<strong>/b:Citation/b:NoAuthor</strong>, <strong>/b:Citation/b:NoTitle</strong>, or <strong>/b:Citation/b:NoYear</strong>).\r<br />\n<br />\nIn BibWord, the <strong>format-citation</strong> is responsible for all formatting of in-text citations.
