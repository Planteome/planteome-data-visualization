The program files directory will change if you system is a 32- or 64-bit system. Furthermore, as of Office 2010 beta, there is a 64-bit version of Office as well. This might also influence the directory structure.</p>\r\n<p>If you&nbsp;can't find&nbsp;the directory, you can do a file search for &quot;APA.XSL&quot;. Make sure that hidden and system directories are included in the search. Normally you will get only one result in a map called &quot;style&quot;. You should put your other styles there as well.</p>",
