I only have 40 references and I am pretty sure that it is the IEEE style that causes adobe professional to crash. I am\r\n using Adobe Acrobat professional 8.0 to convert the word files to pdf. I was wondering if there is an update regarding this issue or if the conversion process to pdf works fine with more recent versions of Adobe.<br>\r\nThanks a lot.</p>\r\n",
