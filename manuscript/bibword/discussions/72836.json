    "Html": "<p>Many thanks for your replies. Jayjaycool's reply that the Edit options show up in Word 2008 is interesting. At least it shows that Microsoft is working on it and that it hopefully might work correctly in Word 2010. I have also tried the macro suggestion of Yves, which works just fine for all citations in the text. It gives exactly the same response as when using the menus from the arrow-box, but it does not work at all when doing the same thing on a citation which is in a footnote. So at least for Word 2007 this functionality is not available for citation in footnotes. I suspect the same will be the case for Word 2008.</p>\r\n<p>Frode</p>",

Unfortunately, it doesn't imply that microsoft is working on it. I think that the context menu shows up in the FN by error in 2008, as FNs are somehow handled differently in Word 2007 and 2008. But hope remains still :)",
