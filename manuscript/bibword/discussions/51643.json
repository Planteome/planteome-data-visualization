    "Html": "<p>In Word 2007 or 2008, there is no concept of active or passive citing.</p>\r\n<p>There are a couple of options:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Write the name yourself then insert the citation. Once you entered the citation, right click and pick &quot;Edit Citation&quot; from the menu. Suppress the author.</p>\r\n    <p>If you only have to do this a couple of times, this will be the fastest solution.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>If you want all your citations to be in the active form, you could create a style which does that. In BibWord, you would set the <i>openbracket</i> and <i>closebracket</i> elements to empty and then format a single entry like:</p>\r\n    <p><span style=\"font-family:'courier new';color:#0000ff;font-size:10pt\">&lt;</span><span style=\"font-family:'courier new';color:#a31515;font-size:10pt\">format</span><span style=\"font-family:'courier new';color:#0000ff;font-size:10pt\">&gt;</span><span style=\"font-family:'courier new';font-size:10pt\">%Author:1%{ (%Year%{: %CitationPages%})}{ (%CitationPages%)}<span style=\"color:#0000ff\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color:#a31515\">format</span><span style=\"color:#0000ff\">&gt;</span></span></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>If you want both active and passive voicing within one style, your only option is to abuse the flags. An example of a style which does flag abuse (for different purposes) can be found in the <a href=\"http://bibliography.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=20331\">Chicago footnote style</a>. At least one person went to great lengths to make a style like that according to this <a href=\"http://bibliography.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=41950\">discussion</a>.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>Externally.&nbsp;What&nbsp;Word does when you&nbsp;want it to format a citation, is passing along a huge number of localized variables. Things like, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;vol&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;, ...&nbsp;in different languages. Apparently, different languages, can use different brackets. So the brackets are passed along in the same way. I have no idea as to where Word stores these strings internally. I'm guessing they will be resources inside some dll.</p>\r\n<p>I would suggest not the play around with the template &quot;templ_prop_OpenBracket&quot; as it might be used by other parts in the stylesheet.</p>\r\n<p>What are you trying to achieve?

If so, check out <a href=\"http://bibword.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=FAQ#Q6\">http://bibword.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=FAQ#Q6</a>&nbsp;.
