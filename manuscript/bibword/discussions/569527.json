Styles working Word 2010 for Windows should work in Word 2011 for Mac. Are you sure they are not showing up? There is a bug in Word for Mac.

There is a Word 2013 and 365. For those, the stylesheet needs to be updated. Information can be found in this discussion forum.<br />\n",

I cant seem to find the bug in which you are talking about could you point me in the right direction then I can make the necessary changes for the university students. It definitely doesn't appear in the MAC version, I will make the changes so that it works on 2013. \r<br />\n<br />\nCould you point me in the right direction, or paste the changes here I need to make so that the MAC version can see it (you talk about a bug).
