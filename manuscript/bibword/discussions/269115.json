    "Html": "<p>That is the expected behaviour. IEEE only requires a number, not the name of the author for in-text citations.</p>\r\n<p>If you want both the reference number and author names, you will have to write your own style which supports that. You could check one of the harvard styles to see how in-text citation with authors is done. Combine that with the %RefOrder% variable used by the IEEE style and you should be good to go.</p>",
