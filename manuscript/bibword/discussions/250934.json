One &quot;current list&quot; of used sources is saved directly to the file and the second (including all added sources) is saved in the\r\n<em>AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Bibliography\\Sources.xml<br>\r\n</em>I am wondering if this is a good place for storing this large list of citations? I mean I don't mind storing the file in this location. I just wonder whether the file is auto-loaded every time I open Word (even an empty document) so that it may slow down\r\n the editor?</p>\r\n<p>Regards,<br>\r\nProzac</p>\r\n",

The first time you access the dropdown, Word has to load the styles one by one to populate the list.</p>",
