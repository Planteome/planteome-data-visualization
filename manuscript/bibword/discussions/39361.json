    "Html": "At the moment it isn't. Processing of pages and volumes attached to the in-text citation are not supported. However, I suggest you use an alternative approach rather than adding the &quot;, p.&quot; in the styles source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Word 2007, right click a citation and choose &quot;Edit Field...&quot;. In the field codes window, you will see something like this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCITATION Pat88 \\l 2060<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the \\s parameter, you can add a suffix to a citation. So in your example you would add <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \\s &quot;, p.22&quot;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nto indicate that at the end of the citation, a comma followed by the page should be added. So the entire thing would look like this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCITATION Pat88 \\l 2060 \\s &quot;, p. 22&quot;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote that the quotation marks around the text you want to add to the end are necessary!\r\n",
