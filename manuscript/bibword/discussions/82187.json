I'm now using this program to help me with my final year university project, but have encountered a problem. When adding references that are double-digits (i.e. 10.), then the alignment in the citations and bibliography box gets messed up.</p>\r\n<p>This is the reference that I am using:</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">13.</span> NHS Primary Care Commissioning (PCC).

When Word inserts the table, it makes an 'incorrect assumption' about the width of the first column.</p>\r\n<p>You can easily solve this manually. Just place your mouse cursor on the column border between the two parts (the cursor should change) and drag it to the right.</p>\r\n<p>Yves</p>",
