Note that this will not sort the elements according to tag! To sort the elements based on Tag, you will have to add the following sortkey for all source types: &lt;sortkey&gt;%Tag%&lt;/sortkey&gt;. For more information on where to place that key, see the <a href=\"http://bibliography.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=23850\">BibWord Guide</a>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these styles are 2 column styles. So by dragging the column separator in Word, you can easily create your tab.\r\n",

Know I download it with IE and it works really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one question: This style is for engl. use and I write my thesis in german (this is the reason for my bad engl.) I found at <a href=\"http://www.matze-bonn.de/progs/progs.html\">http://www.matze-bonn.de/progs/progs.html</a> a DIN 1505 style (<a href=\"http://www.matze-bonn.de/progs/DIN1505 APA-based.XSL\">http://www.matze-bonn.de/progs/DIN1505%20APA-based.XSL</a>). This style is also great, but the tabs are to small and and second line is not indented. Can someone fix this problem, please?\r\n",

There you can set the indentation. Once set, the identation will remain, even after updating the bibliography.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to contact the author of that style to ask him about other changes.\r\n",

DIN 1505 looks more like ISO690 than APA if I'm not mistaken. Also, I believe the author names should be in small-caps (e.g. <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">Dhondt</span>, Yves).
