    "Html": "Hi, I have tweaked a style for the Harvard style I use and I've managed to update the bibliography, however I'm having trouble trying to update the citation in text. For books and book sections I use author, date, but when I add a direct quote I need to add the page numbers, (author, date, p. n). I've tried changing different parts and searching for a solution, but nothing I do will add the page number in the citation in text.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there a way to update the style to add this functionality?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
