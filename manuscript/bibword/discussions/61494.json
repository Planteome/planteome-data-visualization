Is that possible today? Is there an easy&nbsp;way to add a field for the initial(s) and modify the&nbsp;style to use this field? or to modify the LNCS style to trims the first name?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Assaf Marron&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Yes that is possible and no you don't need an extra field for that. If you enter a source, always try to provide a full name, as the style will/should abbreviate the name for you if required. Of course, if the name is already abbreviated it can't extend it.</p>\r\n<p>If you are creating your own style using BibWord, you can use the &quot;a&quot; option for name parts which indicates if a part of a name (be it first, middle, or last) should be abbreviated or not. You can extend this option with a combination of the parameters 's', 'd', and 'p' where</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>s indicates if a space is required if the name exists of multiple parts (e.g. Juan Carlos will become J C);</li>\r\n<li>d indicates if dashes should be kept (e.g. Jean-Phillippe will become J-P);</li>\r\n<li>p indicates if periods should be used after every part (e.g. Juan Carlos will become J.C.).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Consider the following example entry:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Type: Book</li>\r\n<li>Author: Hawking, Stephen</li>\r\n<li>Title: A Brief History of Time</li>\r\n<li>Year: 1988</li>\r\n<li>City: New York</li>\r\n<li>Publsher: Bantam Books</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Now, when using <a title=\"Harvard - Anglia*\" href=\"http://bibword.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=19783\">Harvard Anglia</a>, the bibliography will look like:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">Hawking, S., 1988. <em>A Brief History of Time</em>. New York: Bantam Books.</p>\r\n<p>while using <a title=LNCS href=\"http://bibword.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=19773\">LNCS</a>, the bibliography will look like:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">1. Hawking, Stephen: A Brief History of Time. Bantam Books, New York (1988)</p>\r\n<p>So as you can see, the style decides how to display the name and the end-user&nbsp;does not have to&nbsp;worry about it.</p>",
