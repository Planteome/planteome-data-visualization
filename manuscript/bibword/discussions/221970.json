Philip Strabe, Good stuff, 1965</p>\r\n<p>How can I&nbsp;delete this point after the reference number?</p>\r\n<p>2) With this style sheet you can add a page number directly when you quote something. But it is in german: [1 S.10]</p>\r\n<p>How can I get instead of the S. a p. for page?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you very much.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers, Daniel&nbsp;</p>",

    "Html": "<p>1) Without exact knowledge of the style you are using and where you got it, this is impossible to answer.</p>\r\n<p>2) The abbrevation you see depends on the culture you are writing your text in. A flawed design if you ask me, but that is how Microsoft&nbsp;made the entire thing. Right click on your reference in Word and choose &quot;Edit Field...&quot;. In the dialog, you will see something along the lines of &quot;CITATION Doe10 \\l 1031&quot;. The four digits are the culture to be used. &quot;1031&quot; is used for German in Germany. If you want English, try &quot;1033&quot;.</p>",
