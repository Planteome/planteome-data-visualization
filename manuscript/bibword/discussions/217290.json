The trial versions, unlike the full versions, use a new technology called &quot;Click-to-Run&quot; and are completely virtualized. Information on click-and-run can be found at <a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/office2010/archive/2009/11/06/click-to-run-delivering-office-in-the-21st-century.aspx\">http://blogs.technet.com/b/office2010/archive/2009/11/06/click-to-run-delivering-office-in-the-21st-century.aspx</a></p>\r\n<p>According to the text in the above link, you should have a virtual Q-drive somewhere on your system. It's doubtful that you will be able to access it though. So I doubt you will be able to run other/adapted styles.</p>",
