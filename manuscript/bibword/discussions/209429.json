    "Html": "<p>Hmm, it looks like there might be a bug in the cleanup routine.</p>\r\n<p>I don't have access to my development computer right now, but I think it is caused by the combination of comma space period. A comma followed by a space is not cleaned up. A space followed by a period is. Unfortunately, the resulting comma followed by a period, isn't cleaned up anymore. Try removing the space.</p>\r\n<p>So instead of:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">{%City|CountryRegion%, }{%CountryRegion%, }}{{ %Month:s%} %Year%}.</p>\r\n<p>try:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">{%City|CountryRegion%,}{ %CountryRegion%,}}{{ %Month:s%} %Year%}.</p>\r\n<p>On a side note, as your month and year have a leading space, you would have entered two spaces anyway (which would get cleaned up to one).</p>",
