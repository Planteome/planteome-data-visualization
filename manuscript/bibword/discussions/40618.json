However, I have one problem with it.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>You say this is the style used by &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;. However, if you take a look at the webpage of the journal, and more specifically at <a href=\"http://authors.nejm.org/help/NewMs.asp#jstyle\">http://authors.nejm.org/help/NewMs.asp#jstyle</a>, you will see that your style is totally different from theirs. I checked one of the articles on the main page (<a href=\"http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/359/21/2208\">http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/359/21/2208</a>) and noticed that they do use the style described on the other page. </div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>As far as I can tell, the journal uses the Vancouver citation style of which you can already find a limited implementation on the project page (I'm working on a better version). So, I'm guessing your style actually has a different name and is for a different journal.</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\nOn a side note, I couldn't get the file directly from the link, I had to go to the main page and browse to it from there for some reason.<br>\r\n </div>\r\n<div>Yves</div>\r\n",

    "Html": "Hi Yves, you were absolutely right - got the specifications from &quot;Humana Press&quot; and they described it as New England J. of M. style, but clearly it is not. So I have changed the headline - link also works now. <br>\r\nYou don't have to add it to your main package (which is great) as this style is probably used only by few people.<br>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp; Johannes<br>\r\n",
