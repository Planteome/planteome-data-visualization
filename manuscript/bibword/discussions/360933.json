I was wondering if I could ask for some of your help. I am a scientist writing a paper at the moment for the Lancet which has extremely strict guidance\r\n as to how the referencing should be. Sadly Bibword so far doesn't have a Lancet citation style and I was wondering if there might be any chance of someone quickly writing one? I know absolutely nothing about programming etc so can't really do it myself. I\r\n have had a look at a couple of other referencing things (mendeley, zotorol) but although they do have lancet styles these don't actually fit with the criteria of the Lancet. These criteria can be seen here:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://download.thelancet.com/flatcontentassets/authors/artwork-guidelines.pdf\">http://download.thelancet.com/flatcontentassets/authors/artwork-guidelines.pdf</a></p>\r\n<p>Any help would be hugely appreciated, thanks in advance.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Donald</p>\r\n",
