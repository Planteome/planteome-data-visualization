I have downloaded the styles.zip folder and extracted the files from within it and copied these files (including the MHRAFootNote.XSL) into the <strong>%userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Bibliography\\Style</strong> folder. \r<br />\n<br />\nWhen opening Microsoft Word I can now see all of the styles from the style.zip folder except for the MHRA one. Does anyone know how to resolve this?\r<br />\n<br />\nI have tried the same steps for Office 2010 (by copying into <strong>%programfiles%\\Microsoft Office\\Office14\\Bibliography\\Style</strong>) and this works fine. So seems to be an issue with Office 2013?<br />\n",
