    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nI have been trying to configure a university reference style to work on word for Mac 2011. I have pasted the xsl file in to the word style file in programme files but it still doesn't appear after a restart of both the programme or the pc. \r<br />\n<br />\nIt works perfectly within word 2010. Has anybody else been able to overcome this problem so that I could get this working as soon as possible. The style is a university modified version of Havard specifically designed for the university. \r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance. <br />\n",
