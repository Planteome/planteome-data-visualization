The stylesheet generates HTML and passes it to Word. Due to the way BibWord works, &lt;http://www.yoururl.com&gt; gets seen as a HTML tag. As it is an unprocessable tag, it is ignored by Word (this is correct behaviour from Word). I'm going to look into it, but I doubt this can be fixed as it would imply a totally different treatment of strings for formatting.</p>\r\n<p>Yves</p>\r\n",
