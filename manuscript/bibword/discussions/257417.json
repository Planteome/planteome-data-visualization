There is no distinction between first and last name as there are none. Of course each style can choose the way they format a corporate contributor, but in reality that will come down to just display the entire value for the field.</p>\r\n<p>If what you want is the editor, then you should be using the editor field which is available separately. Depending on the style, the editor could be corporation as well.</p>",
