So, I have to select it and change its style to &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; manually. But, when I update the fields it will return back\r\n to &lsquo;Heading 1 Style&rdquo;. However, this happen only in the document of my thesis!! i.e. if I create a new file and insert a citation there it appears normally in &ldquo;Normal Style&rdquo;!! So what&rsquo;s wrong with my thesis document!!</p>\r\n<p>Thank you.</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>Are your in-text citations linked to your bibliography? If so, try disabling that link and see if that helps.</p>\r\n<p>It is most likely a combination of two things. Word's built-in features and a bad style design in the template you are using. There is not much you can do to get around it. One trick which might help is to use the same macro which is used to get in-text citations in superscript and adapt it so it uses the normal style instead. The macro can be found at <a href=\"http://bibword.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Styles_FAQ&amp;referringTitle=Documentation#Q9\">http://bibword.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Styles_FAQ&amp;referringTitle=Documentation#Q9</a></p>",

Yes all in-text citetions are linked to the bibliography, but I do not know how to remove thart lik (I do not want to change them to a static text). For the case of macro, I've applied the macro, but it just changed the citation to be superscript!!!</p>\r\n<p>I'm wondring why it's working fine in a new document?! but in my thesis document it is not ?</p>",
