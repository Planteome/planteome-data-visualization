When I want to insert a reference all I have to do is surround it by [ref] and [/ref] and the reference is automatically added\r\n at the end of my post.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Obviously this would require some sort of &quot;Show/Hide&quot; function so that you could see your reference. But I think this method is a lot more user friendly than the current methods used in Word.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Does anyone have an idea on how to implement this?</p>\r\n",
