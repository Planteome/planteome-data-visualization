The last source on this page is No 10.</p>\r\n<p>http://www.avirecomp.com/mateo/images/screenshots/bibtable1.png</p>\r\n<p>The second screenie shows the same document just before printing (print preview) - the source No 11 was moved from page 72 to page 71.</p>\r\n<p>http://www.avirecomp.com/mateo/images/screenshots/bibtable2.png</p>\r\n<p>I'm not sure if this has something to do with the bibliography module or maybe with Word's tables?</p>\r\n",
