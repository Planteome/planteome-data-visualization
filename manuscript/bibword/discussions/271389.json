High volume infiltration analgesia in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial\r\n<em>Acta Anaesthesiol Scand</em> 2008;52:1331&ndash;5.</span></p>\r\n<p>However just occasionally I have a citation which I have no volume or issue number for, just year and page number.&nbsp; With my current xsl file it would give a result like this:</p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:14pt\">Andersen LO, Husted H, Otte KS, et al. High volume infiltration analgesia in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial\r\n<em>Acta Anaesthesiol Scand</em> 2008;:1331&ndash;5.</span></p>\r\n<p>Which obviously looks weird and needs manually editing before submission.&nbsp; I have tried putting the colon all over the place in my xsl file, including inside&nbsp; a pair&nbsp; of braces which surround the vol and issue field in the hope it would then\r\n be hidden if these parameters had no value, but it keeps appearing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How should my format field look?&nbsp; It currently is as follows:</p>\r\n<p>&lt;format&gt;{%Author:1%.}{ %Title|ShortTitle% }{&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;%JournalName%&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;} { {&nbsp; %Month:s% {%Day%, }}{ %Year%;}}{{%Volume%}{(%Issue%)}}{:%Pages::%}.{ %Comments%.}&lt;/format&gt;</p>\r\n<p>Many thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Jon</p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:14pt\"><br>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:14pt\"><br>\r\n</span></p>\r\n",

You could use something like:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>When pages, volume, and issue are available: {%Volume%(%Issue%):%Pages::%}</li>\r\n<li>When pages and volume are available but issue is not: {%Volume%:%Pages::%}</li>\r\n<li>When volume and issue are available but not pages: {%Volume%(%Issue%)}</li>\r\n<li>When just pages is available: {%Pages::%}</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you would put those for strings after eachother, you would get the formatting you want:</p>\r\n<p>{%Volume%(%Issue%):%Pages::%}{%Volume%:%Pages::%}{%Volume%(%Issue%)}{%Pages::%}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
