The Havard-Exeter referencing style is very similar to that of the one I am required\r\n to use, with only a few small alterations. Is there any way to edit such things as the max number of people displayed in the code and if so what is the best way to go about it?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance for your help :)</p>\r\n",
