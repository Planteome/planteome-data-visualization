The biggest difference I can tell is the use of 'and' between the last two items in a list of authors in the bibliography. I've attempted to remove the &quot;, and &quot; and replace it just with &quot;, &quot; however, I now get a comma after every entry including if it is a single author. Any suggestions?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks\r<br />\nSham<br />\n",
