    "Html": "If you are using Word 2007, then it is currently not possible. Word 2007 does not know the difference between in-text citations and footnote citations. In Word 2007, citations tend to inherit the paragraph/character style from the surrounding text. CSS formatting is just stripped out. Only the basic html formatting (&lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, ...) is applied.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIf you are using Word 2008 for Mac, then the styles make a difference between in-text and footnote citations. So there you can probably use smallcaps. I have not tested it as I don't have access to a mac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe can only hope that with SP2 (release date scheduled for April 28, 2009), the functionality for footnote citations will be introduced in Word 2007. If so, BibWord will be updated to support it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmallcaps can be used in the bibliography though. There most CSS should work.\r\n",
