You would then create your bibliography as you normally would do. Also, if you add a source, then delete the in-text citation, the source will stay inside the document.</p>\r\n<p>If you use the RefOrder variable/element when displaying the bibliography, citations not used in the text will get a number greater than the number of the last&nbsp;in-text&nbsp;citation. This is the behaviour of Word 2007. I am not convinced that this is what is described by the open xml specification.</p>\r\n",
