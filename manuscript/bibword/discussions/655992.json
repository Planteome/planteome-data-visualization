Those are the fields which are shown by default by Word when adding a new source to a document.<br />\n</blockquote>\nHowever, in Word 2011 for Macintosh, it has no effect on which fields are shown in the &quot;Edit Source&quot; or &quot;Create New Source&quot; dialogs.  What it does change is which fields are marked as &quot;Recommended fields&quot; in the dialogs.  I haven't tested this behavior in other versions of Word.\r<br />\n<br />\n1) Is it possible to change which fields are shown?\r<br />\n<br />\n2) If not, could the documentation be changed to &quot;Those are the fields which are marked as Recommended by Word when adding a new source to a document.&quot;?<br />\n",
