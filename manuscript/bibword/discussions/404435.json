There are just two details that are wrong and I can't fix them any other than doing it manually at the end. It's all about subsequent in-text citations in two cases:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. APA requires you to write out the names of all authors in a source written by three to five authors. However, the second time you cite this source, you only use the first author and &quot;et al&quot;.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. For corporate authors with long, well-known titles you're only required to cite the full title the first time, the second time the short title is enough.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there any way to fix this with coding or something like this? Or has someone created a perfect APA referencing code?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you,<br>\r\nOz</p>\r\n",
