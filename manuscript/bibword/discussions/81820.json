Forgive me if I post again a question already posted.</p>\r\n<p>I have just found Bibword and Bibstyles and I think it is an interesting tool.</p>\r\n<p>I would like to know how can I slighlty change some features of a Style (namely, Harvard).</p>\r\n<p>I see that when I insert a citation in the text body, it is always within round brackets: this is ok when the citation is&nbsp; in the text, but it is not ok when it goes into a foot-note (at the beginning of a foot-note). So, I would like to change the code in order to never get automatically the parentheses.</p>\r\n<p>The question is: how can I modify the code?</p>\r\n<p>Beside, I do not understand how use BibWord. I have downloaded the guide but I do not understand its use.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thakns for the help you can provide,</p>\r\n<p>Regards</p>\r\n<p>Gm</p>",

    "Html": "<p>A BibWord stylesheet groups all formatting info into a single place inside the XSL file: the <em>data</em> variable. So to find out where things are stored, just look for</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">xsl</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">:</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">variable</span> <span style=\"color:Red\">name</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">=</span><span style=\"color:Black\">&quot;</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">data</span><span style=\"color:Black\">&quot;</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span>\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>In it there are a number of child elements defining the behaviour for certain sections. You might want to look to the <em>citation</em> element. Two elements are of importance to you.: <em>openbracket</em> and <em>closebracket</em>. By keeping those elements empty, no surrounding brackets will be shown around (grouped) in-text citations.</p>\r\n<p>Note thqt Word 2007 does not know the difference between in-text citations and footnote citations while Word 2008 for Mac does. In the latter case, you probably shouldn't change the brackets of the <em>citation</em> element but rather of the <em>footnotecitation</em> element.</p>\r\n<p>Yves</p>",
