For references greater than 9, the reference numbers are displayed on multiple lines. Example: reference 12 would be like this:</p>\r\n<table border=0 cellpadding=0 width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=top>\r\n<p>1<br>2</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=top>\r\n<p>Cremonese P, Vanni V.   UDDI4m: UDDI in Mobile Ad Hoc Network. In: IEEE Second Annual Conference on   Wireless On-demand Network Systems and Services; 2005.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>I'm thinking that simply adjusting the width of the number column would solve this. Of course the work around is to reduce the font size for the section. I'm using Calibri size 12.</p>\r\n<p>Would anyone happen to know what to adjust within the file?</p>",
