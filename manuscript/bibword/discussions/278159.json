However I hope that anyone will give me some support.</p>\r\n<p>As I want to change the style of my bibliography I came across many hints how to do that (and nearly all referred to this site in one way or another).</p>\r\n<p>I think I now have basic understanding of how to for example change the brackets surrounding the citation.</p>\r\n<p>I chose the &quot;ISO690Nmerical.xsl&quot; and wanted to change it the way that</p>\r\n<p>1) citation brackets &quot;(&quot; are replaced with &quot;[&quot;</p>\r\n<p>- my problem: the section where they are defined looks like:</p>\r\n<p>&lt;xsl:template name=&quot;templ_prop_OpenBracket&quot; &gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;LCID&quot; /&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;_LCID&quot;&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;localLCID&quot;&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:with-param name=&quot;LCID&quot; select=&quot;$LCID&quot;/&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;/*/b:Locals/b:Local[@LCID=$_LCID]/b:General/b:OpenBracket&quot;/&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp; &lt;/xsl:template&gt;</p>\r\n<p>On several sites I found a section where &quot;&gt;(&lt;&quot; seems to define the bracket. But I can't find this in the standard word files.</p>\r\n<p>2) a full list authors shows up in the bibliography (no et. al)</p>\r\n<p>I honestly didn't understand how to do that. The bibliography seems to show up to 6 authors. Can I simply increase this amount?</p>\r\n<p>If I change the citation format from Iso690Numerical to Iso690 all authors show up but I don't have a numeric reference anymore...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'm aware that this seems to be a quite simple &quot;problem&quot; for you but I'd anyway be glad if someone helps me.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\r\n<p>Tom</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>Regarding 1.</p>\r\n<p>The OpenBracket definition is loaded from a Word resource. There is no way you will be able to change that.</p>\r\n<p>However, you don't&nbsp;need to change that.&nbsp;Wherever a call to templ_prop_OpenBracket is made, you can just replace the call with a simple &lt;xsl:text&gt;(&lt;/xsl:text&gt;. The easiest way to find where to replace them is to look for FirstAuthor, LastAuthor entries as described at <a href=\"http://bibword.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=FAQ&amp;referringTitle=Home#Q6\">http://bibword.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=FAQ&amp;referringTitle=Home#Q6</a></p>\r\n<p>Note that you can already find a style with those changes incorporated at <a href=\"http://bibword.codeplex.com/releases/view/14646\">http://bibword.codeplex.com/releases/view/14646</a></p>\r\n<p>Regarding 2.</p>\r\n<p>Yes. IIRC the styles that come with Word, have that number hardcoded or read from a resource. You have the best chance of finding it&nbsp; by looking for routines called something similar to \"formatPersons\".</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hey,</p>\r\n<p>thank you a lot for answering my question! I tried to implement your hint regarding question 1. I finally lost my brackets at all after replacing the call ;) so I decided to abandon the thought of \"creating\" my own bibliography.</p>\r\n<p>I'm afraid I'm lacking too much basic knowledge about xml...</p>\r\n<p>Instead I took your linked file with beautiful square brackets. Thanks a lot!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I also tried to increase the number of authors in the way you suggested. Finally the \"et al.\" disappeared but the remaining authors were not shown instead. After quite a long time playing around with some parts of this routine I also gave up on this...</p>\r\n<p>May it have something to do with this part:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:variable name=\"cMaxAllow\"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:choose&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:when test=\"$cMaxAuthor &gt; ../b:_MaxAuthor and ../b:_MaxAuthor &gt; 0\"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:value-of select=\"../b:_MaxAuthor\"/&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/xsl:when&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;xsl:value-of select=\"$cMaxAuthor\"/&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'm not sure but instead of defining concrete numbers there's always a reference to other templates if that's the right term.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe you have an idea or know a citation style that is similar to this one!?</p>\r\n<p>I'd be very glad if I can get this done.</p>\r\n<p>Greetings &amp; Thanks</p>",
