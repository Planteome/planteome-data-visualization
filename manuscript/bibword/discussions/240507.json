Did it show up in the list of styles when you wanted to enter a citation? Or didn't you see it there? If this is the style from your university, where did they get it from (or did they made it themselves)? To where did\r\n you copy the style?</p>\r\n<p>All the styles on this site are cross-platform and cross-version. That is, they work on Word 2007 (Windows), 2008 (Mac), 2010 (Windows), and 2011 (Mac).</p>\r\n<p>The asteriks means you can use the additional software if you need extra functionality which is not included in any version of Word. In case of the Harvard reference styles, the additional software is only needed if you require year suffices (e.g.: Doe,\r\n 2006a; Doe, 2006b). If you don't have the same author(s) publishing multiple works in the same year, you don't need the software. If you would use it, it wouldn't do anything.</p>\r\n<p>And even if you needed the year suffices and it is just one or 2 cases, you could do them manually and add the suffix after the year in the source dialog.</p>\r\n<p>I would advise against installing the software on a Mac as you need an older version of Mono. The current releases of windowsbase.dll (Mono) are broken and the software will only&nbsp;corrupt your document! Installing older versions of Mono might (or not)\r\n harm other software.</p>\r\n",
