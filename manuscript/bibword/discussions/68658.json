    "Html": "<p>The short answer is&nbsp;no. Word does not send out formatting information to the stylesheets. So all in-text citations should be of the same format: either (Author, Year) or Author (Year)</p>\r\n<p>However, there are a couple of workarounds. The easy one:&nbsp;you could type the author name yourself, then insert the citation and suppress the author. That way, the year would still be there between the brackets. To suppress the author, you have to right click on a citation&nbsp;and pick &quot;Edit citation&quot; from the menu. Of course, this requires you type out the names yourself.</p>\r\n<p>If you have some XSLT knowledge, you can get around things by giving the suppress flags a different meaning. You could create two versions of a citation format&nbsp;and depending on what you 'suppress', you could pick what citation to display. For an example of a style which 'abuses' these flags in a similar way, see <a href=\"http://bibword.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=20331\">http://bibword.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=20331</a>&nbsp;. But this requires some programming skills.</p>\r\n<p>Off-topic: one thing to keep in mind is that it is considered bad practice to use both types of citations in a work. You should stick to either Author (Year) or (Author, Year).</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Either you should do as suggested in the original reply (type the name yourself, then insert the citation and suppress the author) or you have to create a style yourself.</p>\r\n<p>Assuming you start from the ASA style on this site, you would probably need to change the following things:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>  <span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">openbracket</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span>(<span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">openbracket</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span>\r\n  <span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">closebracket</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span>)<span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">closebracket</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span>\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>into</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>  <span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">openbracket</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">openbracket</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span>\r\n  <span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">closebracket</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">closebracket</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span>\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>This way, there won't be any more parentheses around your citation at all. After this, you will have to manipulate every entry the way you want it to be. A quick suggestion you can try out is to look for:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>  { %Year|&quot;n.d.&quot;%}{%YearSuffix%}{:%CitationPages:::e%}{, vol.%CitationVolume%}\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>and replace it by</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>  { <strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">(</span></strong>%Year|&quot;n.d.&quot;%}{%YearSuffix%}{:%CitationPages:::e%}{, vol.%CitationVolume%}<strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">)</span></strong>\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>I wouldn't call it the most clean solution ever, but it might just do the trick for you.</p>\r\n<p>Yves</p>",
