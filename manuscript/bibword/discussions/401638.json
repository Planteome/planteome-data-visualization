This tool seems very promising, especially for users of Latex.</p>\r\n<p>After adding style sheets to the word (on MAC) I was able to get a proper numerical citation (IEEE style). However, when I try to add bibliography, the menu still offers only 4 in-built styles from Word. Using any of them changes the citation style in text\r\n as well to match the chosen bibliography style.</p>\r\n<p>Is there any solution for this?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n",
