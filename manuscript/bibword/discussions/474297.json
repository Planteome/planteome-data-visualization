The other styles available in the zip file appear to work just fine.<br />\n<br />\nEDIT: I got it to appear by changing the first line from iso etc. to utf-8, and by copying the file from my downloads folder and pasting it into the styles folder. For some reason, it wasn't responding to the drag-and-drop. However, all my sources now say unspecified format. Do I need to re-enter my bibliography and start over?<br />\n",
