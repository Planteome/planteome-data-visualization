    "Html": "<p>There is no such thing. And it is rather hard to implement one since it has to take language characteristics in account. For example, a journal called \"maths in economy\" would become \"Maths in Economy\" with a small \"i\" and not \"Maths In Economy\".&nbsp;So it is not like you can capitalize every word just like that.</p>\r\n<p>Even Word's own capitalize function does not take such things into account. It is just too language dependent. Of course, if you don't care about language specific cases and only want every word capitalized whether it should be or not, I would suggest writing a macro which picks up all your sources, gets the title of each one, applies Word's capitalization function (Selection.Range.Case = wdTitleWord) and then inserts that as the new title.</p>",
