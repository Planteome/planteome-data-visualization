Great work guys!</p>\r\n<p>My Problem:<br>I am running OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) with Office 2008.<br>I have just downloaded the <em>styles.zip</em> (<a id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MasterContent_Content_ReleasePanelOrderingContainer_ReleaseFilesCtrl_recommendedFileHyperLink\" tabindex=9 href=\"../Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=15852#DownloadId=40238\">BibWord styles</a>), from the website, extracted it and copied the contents into <em>/Applications/Microsoft Office 2008/Microsoft Word.app/Contents/Resources/Style/.</em></p>\r\n<p>All styles show up correctly in the Citation Manager (see http://yfrog.com/78screenshot20091007at7ocp)</p>\r\n<p>However when I click on <em>Insert -&gt; Document Elements -&gt; Bibliography </em>none of the newly imported styles appear in the list of availble Bibliography styles (see http://yfrog.com/5escreenshot20091007at7ocp)</p>\r\n<p>Am I missing a step to import the styles also for the Bibliography list / Works Cited? What am I doing wrong?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for your help!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MasterContent_Content_ReleasePanelOrderingContainer_ReleaseDescriptionLiteral\"> </span></p>",

Just pick the style from the citations box after you inserted the bibliography in another style.
