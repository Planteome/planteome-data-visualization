Although I have found answers on most of my questions, there is still one which makes me confused. I will\r\n be forever grateful if someone could help me to figure out how can I merge two citations into one reference when using HarvardAnglia2008 style?</p>\r\n<p>For example, I am referencing two sources for one concept, Smith 2008 and Brown 2009. Both are created as two independent sources in my library. So if I write something like:\r\n<strong><em>the concept of blablabla is studied by various authors</em></strong> and then cite both I have:\r\n<strong><em>the concept of blablabla is studied by various authors (Smith, 2008) (Brown, 2009).\r\n</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Whereas I need the following: <strong><em>the concept of blablabla is studied by various authors (Smith, 2008; Brown, 2009)</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Thus my question is if it is possible to merge/include two indepentent sources into one in one paretheses when referencing?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you so much for any help/advice!</p>\r\n",
