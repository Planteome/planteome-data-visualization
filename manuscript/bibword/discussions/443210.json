I saw this post from last year: <a href=\"https://bibword.codeplex.com/discussions/349045\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bibword.codeplex.com/discussions/349045</a> and emailed the email address but have got no answer yet. If somebody has it/knows where to find it/can make it I would be extremely grateful. I also don't know how I would go about installing it if somebody does give me it, so advice on that would be appreciated also (I'm using Office 360 with student licence if that's important).\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you very much!<br />\n",
