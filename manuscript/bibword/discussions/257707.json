Today I added some text and some new citations and updated the Bibliography. All reference numbers in brackets (AMA) seem to be correct but when I click them with CTRL (links enabled) then I jump to strange unknown locations.\r\n After clicking the citation No 168 it jumps to the title page etc.</p>\r\n<p>Also, I've noticed that when updating bibliography with a large number of sources Word is &quot;not responding&quot; for several seconds. I'm not sure if this may be the reason.</p>\r\n<p>I know the issue may not be directly related to BibWord but probably to Word itself but... who knows the Bibliography module better than you :-)</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your support!</p>\r\n<p>Regards,<br>\r\nM.</p>\r\n",
