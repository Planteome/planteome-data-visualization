I do not like this, and I can force the table to keep the rows by checking off &quot;allow row to break across pages&quot;. However, upon refreshing the reference list, the setting is back again... Is it possible to change once-and-for-all?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you very much for a fantastic script.</p>\r\n<p>/Jakob</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Doubtful.</p>\r\n<p>The output of the stylesheet is HTML. As HTML doesn't know the concept of pages, I doubt there is some HTML/CSS setting which would translate to the Word option for &quot;allow row to break across pages&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>A&nbsp;similar issue exists when the first column isn't width enough and you have to set it by hand after each update. I have been looking to output WordML rather than HTML by wrapping the WordML inside the HTML but without luck so far.</p>",
