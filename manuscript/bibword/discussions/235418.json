I tried to adapt one of the styles (ISO with square brackets) to my needs but there is one thing I don't even now how to deal with.</p>\r\n<p>Here it is how it should look like:</p>\r\n<pre>[1]   blah blah blah\r\n      blah blah blah\r\n[2]   blah blah blah\r\n      blah blah blah</pre>\r\n<p>As you can see the reference numbers form a separate column.

There are several example styles available illustrating this behaviour (e.g. IEEE at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bibword.codeplex.com/releases/view/19764\">http://bibword.codeplex.com/releases/view/19764</a>&nbsp;).</p>\r\n<p>If you are working with one of the styles that come with Word, then it is up to you to look into the code yourself. Those styles are not supported here.</p>\r\n<p>One tip I can give is that Word will insert a blank paragraph before and after your bibliography if you try to work with a table. A workaround consists in wrapping your table between two paragraphs where you put 1 letter and make those invisible. The way\r\n BibWord does this is by putting the following line above and below the table:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color:#a31515\">p</span> <span style=\"color:red\">class</span><span style=\"color:blue\">=</span><span style=\"color:black\">&quot;</span><span style=\"color:blue\">MsoBibliography</span><span style=\"color:black\">&quot;</span> <span style=\"color:red\">style</span><span style=\"color:blue\">=</span><span style=\"color:black\">&quot;</span><span style=\"color:blue\">display:none;</span><span style=\"color:black\">&quot;</span><span style=\"color:blue\">&gt;</span>x<span style=\"color:blue\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color:#a31515\">p</span><span style=\"color:blue\">&gt;</span>\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n",
