    "Html": "<p>Unfortunately your solution won't work. There are at least two reasons I can think of:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>You can not display nothing for certain in-text citations. If you don't display anything (which you would do for 2 and 3 in your example), Word would display &quot;<strong>Invalid Source Specified.</strong>&quot;.</li>\r\n<li>If the sequence would be [6, 9, 10, 11, 12], your solution would abbreviate it to [6-12] rather than [6, 9-12].</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The problem is the way Word process in-text citations: 1-by-1, even if the citations are grouped together. If they would have send everything in one go, similar as to how a bibliography is send, then logic could be added.</p>",
