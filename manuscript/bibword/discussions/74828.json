    "Html": "<p>The sequence of in-text citations cannot be manipulated automatically. You can do it manually. See <a href=\"http://bibword.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=FAQ#Q2\">http://bibword.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=FAQ#Q2</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>\r\n<p>It seems like you are&nbsp;looking for&nbsp;an author-date style. There are a couple of Harvard variants on this site which will do partially what you want. The easiest option is probably starting from one of them and editing it to fit your needs.</p>\r\n<p>More information on the formatting can be found at</p>\r\n<li style=\"padding-left:30px\">the short and incomplete tutorial at <a href=\"http://bibword.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Tutorial\">http://bibword.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Tutorial</a> </li>\r\n<li style=\"padding-left:30px\">the&nbsp;manual at <a href=\"http://bibword.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=34918#DownloadId=89196\">http://bibword.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=34918#DownloadId=89196</a> </li>\r\n<p>Some starting points. For bibliography entries, you probably want to format your authors using the following string:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>{%Last|First|Middle%} {%First:a%}{%Middle:a%}</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>And the entry itself (assuming 49 is the volume or issue&nbsp;number) something along the lines:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>{%Author:0|Title%}{ (%Year%)}{ %Title%.}{ %JournalName%}{ %Volume|Issue%{:%Pages:::%}}{ %Pages:::%}\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The first part (%Author:0|Title%)&nbsp;ensures that if there is no known author, the title is displayed first before the year. In your example, the output would become:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>Analysis of the influence of substrate on coral reef fish communities (1978) Mar Biol 49:317-323\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>If the work has an author, the title of the work is displayed after the year. Then you have the journal name. Finally, the volume or issue and the pages are displayed. The repitition of the Pages variable at the end is a failsafe mechanism. If you don't specify a volume or an issue, the pages will be displayed without a colon in front of them, e.g.</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>Luckhurst BE, Luckhurst K (1978) Analysis of the influence of substrate on coral reef fish communities. Mar Biol 317-323\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I have seen dozens of formats looking almost like yours, all with their tiny differences: year not&nbsp;between parentheses, title in italics, periods between every element, ... The fact is, that except for some really large bodies like APA, ASA, and AMA, most styles are limited to a specific university or/and a handfull of journals.</p>\r\n<p>I doubt you will find anything easier than BibWord. BibWord concentrates everything you&nbsp;need to format an entry into a single data variable. Basically, of the more than 3000 lines of code in a BibWord xsl, you only need&nbsp;the&nbsp;code inside the following structure:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">xsl</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">:</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">variable</span> <span style=\"color:Red\">name</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">=</span><span style=\"color:Black\">&quot;</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">data</span><span style=\"color:Black\">&quot;</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span>\r\n  <span style=\"color:Green\">&lt;!-- The only part of the code that matters to format citations and bibliographies. --&gt;</span>\r\n<span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">xsl</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">:</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">variable</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span>\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>And even of those, you probably only need to change 50 lines or so if you start from an existing style.</p>\r\n<p>I am working on a better documentation for BibWord, so I am interested in learning which parts of the above links I posted were not clear to you.</p>",
