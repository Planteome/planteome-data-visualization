    "Html": "I have a problem with the bibliography display.  The first column number does not displayed correctly.  I found the problem was that it is displayed as a table with two columns.  The first column width is 0.25&quot;.  Since I uses a larger font, it is too narrow.  If I format it using Table layout to increase to 0.35&quot; or wider, it will be fine.  Is there anyway to change it in the style sheet so I don't have to do this every time manually?  Thanks.<br />\n",
