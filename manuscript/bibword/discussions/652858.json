A comment inside the XSL-file indicates that the style comes from BibWord version 2.8. That's why I think my question would be in the right place here.\r<br />\n<br />\nSince I use Microsoft Office 2013 I copied the XSL-file to <code>%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Bibliography\\Style\\</code> and restarted Word afterwards, but that style doesn't appear in the reference style list in Word.\r<br />\n<br />\nHas somebody an idea what could be a problem?\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards<br />\n",
