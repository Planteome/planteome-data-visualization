Using the BibWord XSL templates has been very successful this - what a great tool!</p>\r\n<p>However, some of my students have been asking about a version for Word 2008 on Mac.</p>\r\n<p>I have been able to get the Mac to recognise my Harvard XSL stylesheet as an available style, but my version of Harvard is not then given as a possible bibliography style. I wondered if anyone else has had some difficulties with this and whether they were\r\n able to find a work around.</p>\r\n<p>I wonder if it is something to do with the location of the BIBFORM.xml file that seems to determine available bibliography fields in the Windows version (and which I have been required to edit in my Windows version of the style), but cannot find this file\r\n on the Mac system.</p>\r\n<p>Any suggestions would be gratefully received.</p>\r\n<p>With thanks in advance</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>John</p>\r\n",

Where in Windows you can only specify the row on which an item is displayed in the 'Edit Source' dialog, on a Mac, you can also&nbsp;change the column.
