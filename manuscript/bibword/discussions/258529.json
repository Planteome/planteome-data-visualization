    "Html": "<p>The first link you provide does not work.</p>\r\n<p>What exactly are you trying to achieve? Your title makes me assume you are talking about URLs which are in your bibliography, yet the discussion you are pointing to is about linking in-text citations to bibliography entries. Could you clarify what you want to do?</p>\r\n<p>The citation_as_link feature is intended to link in-text citations to entries in the bibliography. It has nothing to do with formatting URLs present in your bibliography. The decision on wheter an URL is formatted as a hyperlink or not in your bibliography depends on the flags which are used after the URL variable in format strings. If there is an 'l' (so %URL:l%) then hyperlinks will be made, otherwise not. In the Harvard Anglia style that flag is set.</p>",
