This would help to ensure that our documents are referred to consistently throughout our documentation\r\n suite.</p>\r\n<p>To illustrate, the full title of a document might be&nbsp;<em>The Official Acme Widget Company Handbook for Employees</em>, with the short title being&nbsp;<em>The Employee Handbook</em>, since it's only used internally. It would be desirable if the in-body\r\n citation could call this short title along with a numeric reference, thus:</p>\r\n<p>&quot;... as noted in <em>The Employee Handbook</em> [1], all staff are required to ...&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>Any suggestions that you could offer about this would be greatly appreciated. For what it's worth, we're using the CSE - Citation Sequence style, which in other respects fits our needs very well.</p>\r\n",
