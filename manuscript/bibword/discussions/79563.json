All boxes are inactive and &quot;missing&quot; is inscribed in the style drop-down box. I downloaded all the styles from bibword. However I don't have any bibliography folder under Office12 (windows). Although I created bibliography/styles folder and pasted the styles there, I couldn't activate the service. Please help!</p>\r\n<p>Seljuk</p>",
