Only if the website has no title, the title of the&nbsp;individual page will be used. This is also\r\n illustrated in the fact that documents from internet sites use the exact same formatting.</p>\r\n<p>Note that the title of a website is not its base address. So in your example the title of the website is actually &quot;The White House&quot; and not &quot;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov\">http://www.whitehouse.gov</a>&quot; as you entered it.</p>\r\n",
