'Harvard referencing' is a name for a family of referencing systems which are all based on (author, date) for in-text citations. So APA and Chicago are&nbsp;also examples of Harvard referencing. You will have to ask your instructor about which style he uses. Don't ask him for the name, ask him for a document (or&nbsp;url)&nbsp;with the full specification of the 'standard' he wishes you to use.</p>",
