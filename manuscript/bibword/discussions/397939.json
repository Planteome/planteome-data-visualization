This tool is very useful!</p>\r\n<p>I have some doubts about ABNT style.</p>\r\n<p>First: When I cite more than one page, the ABNT Style shows, for example: &quot;(COELHO, 2010, p. 10-13)&quot;. Accord to ABNT, this should be: &quot;&quot;(COELHO, 2010, pp. 10-13)&quot;. How can I put other &quot;p&quot;?</p>\r\n<p>Second: In the bibliography, when I have more than one book with the same author, ABNT tells to replace the author name in the second (third an so on) citation by &quot;______.&quot; Can I do that with ABNT style?</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
