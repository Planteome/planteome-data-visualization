When i have to cite more than one source of consecutive order it is no problem to generate the following appearance:</p>\r\n<p>[3,4,5,6,7]</p>\r\n<p>Is it possible to generate the following appearance if theres more than two consecutive sources?</p>\r\n<p>[3-7]</p>\r\n<p>Also instead of for example [2,3,4,5,10] it should look like [2-5,10].</p>\r\n<p>Can something like that be done by editing the XSL file?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Alex</p>\r\n",

Just go over every citation field and process its contents.</p>",
