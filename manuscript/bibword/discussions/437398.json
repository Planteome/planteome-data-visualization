However when I experimented with it back in 2007 when the feature was first introduced, I noticed that you could change properties of a source as long as the properties were originally defined. You could use this 'bug' to your advantage to remove the comments with a macro like this:<br />\n<pre><code>Sub Test()\n    Dim s As Source\n    \n    For Each s In ActiveDocument.Bibliography.Sources\n        If InStr(s.XML, &quot;&lt;b:Comments&gt;&quot;) &gt; 0 Then\n            s.Field(&quot;Comments&quot;) = &quot;&quot;\n        End If\n    Next\nEnd Sub</code></pre>\n\n",
