    "Html": "Thank you for the excellent work. Unlike Microsoft's files, BibWord enabled me to create new styles or modify them according to the editors requirements, with minimum effort (and xslt knowledge).<br />\nI'd like to ask whether there is a way to have the authors' initials appear in the in-text citations, only for different authors with the same last name.<br />\nExample:<br />\n(Peterson K., 2008; Peterson R.A., 2002; Lewis, 1999; Rogers, 1965)<br />\n<br />\nTwo different Petersons, but only one Lewis and only one Rogers. Some styles require that in this case the authors' initials should be mentioned too.<br />\n<br />\nI guess that an additional option is needed for %First% and %Middle% in the &lt;namelists&gt; (&lt;first_person&gt; and &lt;other_persons&gt;) that would allow initials to appear for non-unique author names. An additional template checking for non-unique author names is also needed. Unfortunately, my knowledge to create this option and the corresponding template, is insufficient.<br />\n<br />\nThanks for any help<br />\nAleg51<br />\n",
