<div class="wikidoc"><h2>BibWord</h2><a href="https://bibword.codeplex.com/releases/view/104366">Latest version (v.2.9)</a>
<h4>Introduction</h4>Starting with Microsoft Word 2007, customers with knowledge of XML and XSLT can create their own stylesheets to format citation and bibliography fields within their Word documents. Although still in its infancy, the technology looks very promising for everyone interested in writing scientific articles. Unfortunately, the technology is poorly documented and for most customers the stylesheets which come with Word are overly complex to be used as a guideline for developing new stylesheets.<br /><br /><i>BibWord</i> is an XSLT template which attempts to simplify the process of creating new bibliography styles. With the help of the <i>BibWord Extender</i> tool, the functionality of the bibliography styles can even be extended.
<h4>Advantages</h4>Some of the advantages of the <i>BibWord</i> approach are:
<ul><li>the elimination of the need to understand and write XSLT;</li>
<li>the introduction of a simple conditional language to format reference data depending on its availability;</li>
<li>the grouping of all formatting information allowing users to update or change existing BibWord styles in seconds;</li>
<li>the possibility to use numerical in-text citations based on the order of the bibliography entries through the <a href="https://bibword.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=BibWord%20Extender&referringTitle=BibWord">BibWord Extender</a> tool;</li>
<li>the possibility to use year suffices if the same author published multiple works in the same year through the <a href="https://bibword.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=BibWord%20Extender&referringTitle=BibWord">BibWord Extender</a> tool. </li></ul>
<h4>Information</h4>More information on the formatting capabilities of <i>BibWord</i> can be found:
<ul><li>in the &#39;BibWord Guide&#39; which comes with each release;</li>
<li>in the style template which comes with an example for formatting books;</li>
<li>in a number of publically available styles implemented so far;</li>
