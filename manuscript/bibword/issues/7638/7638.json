      "Message": "1)Are you certain you are looking in the correct place? Depending on your installation you might have an x86 and x64 version of your program files directory. It's worth checking them both.\r\n\r\n2)Have you installed the full version of Word or the click-to-run one? The styles are only working with the full version. There is no way to use them with the click-to-run installation. To check if you are running the click-to-run version, check if your Office14 folder contains winword.exe? If not, you are using the click-to-run version and you are out of luck.",
