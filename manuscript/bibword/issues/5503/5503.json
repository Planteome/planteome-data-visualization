    "Description": "Hi there, I wonder if any of you can help me...\n \nWhenever I click on the download button, a box appears asking me to agree or disagree to the T&Cs.  Obviously I agree to them.  The box then disaapears and the little help bar at the top of the internet explorer window (below the tabs) appears.  I click on this and select 'download file'.  Then ... nothing happens!!  How can I download this tool?  I have been able to download it before but I had to install a new harddrive and so I now need it again (because it's a bloody  useful thing!)\n \nAny advice would be great,\n \nThanks",
