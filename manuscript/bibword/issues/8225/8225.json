    "Description": "I use mostly Harvard (Anglia) style for referencing in my work. After I updated to Mac Word 2011, all the references with the surname of the first author starting with a 'W' keep appearing on the top of my bibliography. I am not sure if this is a BibWord-related problem, since those references appear on the top of the list in Citation Source Manager, too.\nÂ \nIs there a workaround for this?",
