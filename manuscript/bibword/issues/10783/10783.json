If you use the l parameter, so %URL:l% the URL will be displayed as a clickable link.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make an entire entry a clickable link, then you might try &lt;a href='{%URL%}'&gt;the rest of your entry here.&gt;/a:&lt; . Basically the same thing you would do when introducing bold, italics, ...\r\n\r\nBut I would advise against that approach as it is highly unlikely that you will have a URL for each entry.",

Probably it would be better to have not  entire entry a clickable but only a number before the entry. The first variant works well. But a URL could be very long sometimes and I don't want to show entire link while keeping it alive   ",
