      "Message": "As far as I can tell this error is originating from windowsbase.dll. Are you using the one provided with this installation or the one coming with Mono? If you are using the one coming with Mono, download the one coming with BibWord and use that one instead (just place it in the same directory as the exe). If you are using the one coming with this installation, try renaming it to something else. With a bit of luck, if you try to rerun the program, it will use the one coming with Mono instead. There might be a fix in there. If not, I'm afraid there is not much I can do as I don't have a Mac system around anymore to test with.",
