    "Description": "Thank you for this. I have a problem though. I downloaded and installed the bibliography styles then I did a in text citation and selected the Vancouver style, all of the styles I just added where there to choose from. Then I selected insert/document elements/bibliography to create a bibliography list at the end of the document. The elements gallery appears and then i am asked to confirm the citation style in a drop down menu on the left side of document. In the drop down menu none of the citation style I added from this download are there only the 4 default styles. Would please happen to know of a solution for this? It would be most appreciated. Thank you Andrewï»¿",
