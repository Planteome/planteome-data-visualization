    "Description": "Yves this is just to let you know that there is a bug in the abbreviate-name function. The code that deals with inserting dashes (when keepDashes = 1) and spaces (when keepSpaces = 1) does not work. The reason is that you've missed the \"$\" when you test the two parameters (lines 1803 and 1820 are\n<xsl:if test=\"keepDashes = 1\"> and <xsl:if test=\"keepSpaces = 1\"> instead of <xsl:if test=\"$keepDashes = 1\"> and <xsl:if test=\"$keepSpaces = 1\">). I know that the issue occurs in HarvardAnglia.XLS and the main template. I haven't checked the rest.",
