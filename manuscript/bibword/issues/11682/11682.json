    "Description": "Hi\nFirstly I would like to thank you for your awesome job on BibWord. It really helped me out.\nSecondly, I have created a referencing style based on my university's guidelines, and using your xml templates. The referencing style is a numbered style.\nI would like to ask why the citations inside text boxes have different ordering than to those outside. Whenever I add a citation in a text-box, it becomes the last source in the bibliography, regardless of the order in which the citations are. For example, if I have citations A & B in text-boxes, and citation X outside a text box, the order of the bibliography becomes: 1.X 2.A 3.B\nI was wondering if there is a way to fix this.\nThanks",
