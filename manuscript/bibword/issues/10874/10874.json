    "Description": "Hi, \n\nfor those that may be using a work computer with prudent and busy system administrators: anybody had the issue of not having the writing permission for the directory where Words finds its references styles? (for me some'n like: C:Program FilesMicrosoft OfficeOffice14BibliographyStyle ) \n\nOf course in theory you can get the administrator to do it... but these guys tend to have limited availability for such issues. \n\nSO: anybody would know how to tell Word to look for ref styles in another directory? e.g. one where I would have writing permission and could play around with the styles files.",
